Proteasomal inhibition alters the trafficking of the neurotrophin receptor TrkA. 
Neurotrophin receptors of the Trk family promote neuronal survival. The signal transduction of Trk receptors is regulated by endosomal trafficking. Monoubiquitination of receptor tyrosine kinases is an established signal for sorting of internalized receptors to late endosomes. The NGF receptor TrkA is sorted to late endosomes and undergoes ubiquitination, indicating a so far undefined regulatory role of proteasomal activity in the trafficking of TrkA. Surprisingly, we found that proteasomal inhibition alters the trafficking of TrkA from the late endosomal sorting pathway to the recycling pathway. Many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with impaired proteasomal activity. Thus, our study suggests that missorting of neurotrophic receptors might contribute to neuronal death in those neurodegenerative diseases that are known to be associated with impaired proteasomal function.
