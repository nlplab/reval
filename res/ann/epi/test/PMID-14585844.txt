Regulation of beta1C and beta1A integrin expression in prostate carcinoma cells. 
beta(1C) and beta(1A) integrins are two splice variants of the human beta(1) integrin subfamily that act as an inhibitor and a stimulator of cell proliferation, respectively. In neoplastic prostate epithelium, both these variants are down-regulated at the mRNA level, but only beta(1C) protein levels are reduced. We used an experimental model consisting of PNT1A, a normal immortalized prostate cell line, and LNCaP and PC-3, two prostate carcinoma cell lines, to investigate both the transcription/post-transcription and translation/post-translation processes of beta(1C) and beta(1A). Transcriptional regulation played the key role for the reduction in beta(1C) and beta(1A) mRNA expression in cancer cells, as beta(1C) and beta(1A) mRNA half-lives were comparable in normal and cancer cells. beta(1C) translation rate decreased in cancer cells in agreement with the decrease in mRNA levels, whereas beta(1A) translation rate increased more than 2-fold, despite the reduction in mRNA levels. Both beta(1C) and beta(1A) proteins were degraded more rapidly in cancer than in normal cells, and pulse-chase experiments showed that intermediates and/or rates of beta(1C) and beta(1A) protein maturation differ in cancer versus normal cells. Inhibition of either calpain- or lysosomal-mediated proteolysis increased both beta(1C) and beta(1A) protein levels, the former in normal but not in cancer cells and the latter in both cell types, albeit at a higher extent in cancer than in normal cells. Interestingly, inhibition of the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway increased expression of ubiquitinated beta(1C) protein without affecting beta(1A) protein levels in cancer cells. These results show that transcriptional, translational, and post-translational processes, the last involving the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway, contribute to the selective loss of beta(1C) integrin, a very efficient inhibitor of cell proliferation, in prostate malignant transformation.
